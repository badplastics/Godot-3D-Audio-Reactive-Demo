# Godot-3D-Audio-Reactive-Demo
A simple bar-based audio visualizer, based on Godot's 2D <a href="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/528">"Audio Spectrum Demo."</a>

Created in Godot 4.1.2.

Uses a simple Blender cube modified so its origin is in the centre of its bottom face. This ensures that the bars align to their bottom baseline rather than their vertical centre.

Camera position and max height of the bars is calculated dynamically 
based on `VU_COUNT` (i.e. number of bars).

Project comes with an audio sample produced by myself, though any WAV or OGG should work.
